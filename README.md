## Credits

I copied some of the setup used by [Nicolas Hery](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup?tab=readme-ov-file).

## System update

First thing you need to do, on any OS actually, is update the system! For that: **Apple Icon > About This Mac** then **Software Update...**.

## System preferences

If this is a new computer, there are a couple of tweaks I like to make to the System Preferences. Feel free to follow these, or to ignore them, depending on your personal preferences.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock

## Security

I recommend checking that basic security settings are enabled. You will be happy to have done so if ever your Mac is lost or stolen.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Users & Groups: If you haven't already set a password for your user during the initial set up, you should do so now
- Security & Privacy > General: Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins (you can keep a grace period of a couple minutes if you prefer, but I like to know that my computer locks as soon as I close it)
- Security & Privacy > FileVault: Make sure FileVault disk encryption is enabled
- iCloud: If you haven't already done so during set up, enable Find My Mac

## Homebrew

Package managers make it so much easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for macOS is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

### Install

An important dependency before Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Developer Tools** for **Xcode**. These include compilers that will allow you to build things from source. You can install them directly from the terminal with:

```
xcode-select --install
```

Once that is done, we can install Homebrew by copy-pasting the installation command from the [Homebrew homepage](http://brew.sh/) inside the terminal:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Follow the steps on the screen. You will be prompted for your user password so Homebrew can set up the appropriate permissions.

Once installation is complete, you can run the following command to make sure everything works:

```
brew doctor
```

### Usage

To install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

```
brew install <formula>
```

To see if any of your packages need to be updated:

```
brew outdated
```

To update a package:

```
brew upgrade <formula>
```

Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to rollback. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

```
brew cleanup
```

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

```
brew list --versions
```

### Homebrew Services

A nice extension to Homebrew is [Homebrew Services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services). It will automatically launch things like databases when your computer starts, so you don't have to do it manually every time.

Homebrew Services will automatically install itself the first time you run it, so there is nothing special to do.

After installing a service (for example a database), it should automatically add itself to Homebrew Services. If not, you can add it manually with:

```
brew services <formula>
```

Start a service with:

```
brew services start <formula>
```

At anytime you can view which services are running with:

```
brew services list
```

## Git

macOS comes with a pre-installed version of [Git](http://git-scm.com/), but we'll install our own through Homebrew to allow easy upgrades and not interfere with the system version. To do so, simply run:

```
brew install git
```

When done, to test that it installed fine you can run:

```
which git
```

The output should be `/usr/local/bin/git`.

Let's set up some basic configuration. Download the [.gitconfig](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.gitconfig) file to your home directory:

```
cd ~
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.gitconfig
```

It will add some color to the `status`, `branch`, and `diff` Git commands, as well as a couple aliases. Feel free to take a look at the contents of the file, and add to it to your liking.

Next, we'll define your Git user (should be the same name and email you use for [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)):

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

They will get added to your `.gitconfig` file.

On a Mac, it is important to remember to add `.DS_Store` (a hidden macOS system file that's put in folders) to your project `.gitignore` files. You also set up a global `.gitignore` file, located for instance in your home directory (but you'll want to make sure any collaborators also do it):

```
cd ~
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup/master/.gitignore
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```

## Clipboard Manager

Install the Maccy clipboard manager. In a terminal (open using spotlight **Cmd-Space** then type **Terminal**). 

```
brew install maccy
```
