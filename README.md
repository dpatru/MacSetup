I copied some of the setup used by [Nicolas Hery](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup?tab=readme-ov-file).

## System update

First thing you need to do, on any OS actually, is update the system! For that: **Apple Icon > About This Mac** then **Software Update...**.

## System preferences

If this is a new computer, there are a couple of tweaks I like to make to the System Preferences. Feel free to follow these, or to ignore them, depending on your personal preferences.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock

## Security

I recommend checking that basic security settings are enabled. You will be happy to have done so if ever your Mac is lost or stolen.

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Users & Groups: If you haven't already set a password for your user during the initial set up, you should do so now
- Security & Privacy > General: Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins (you can keep a grace period of a couple minutes if you prefer, but I like to know that my computer locks as soon as I close it)
- Security & Privacy > FileVault: Make sure FileVault disk encryption is enabled
- iCloud: If you haven't already done so during set up, enable Find My Mac

## Clipboard Manager

Install the Maccy clipboard manager. In a terminal (open using spotlight **Cmd-Space** then type **Terminal**). 

```
brew install maccy
```
